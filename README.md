Master and Step-1 branch should be the same. To see the changes in each step check out the appropriate branch. If you want to run Step-2 or Step-3 you will need to download the rrd-library and change your package.json file to link to where you stored it locally.

You can download the rrd-library repo from here, then follow the directions there to build it.

OR you can get the tar file from Google Drive at: https://drive.google.com/a/rrd.com/file/d/0Bz_ZIIaKjmfkM1J4aFd2cllBXzQ/view?usp=sharing
